# Visitor Info Logger

This is a simple PHP script that logs the visitor's IP address, port number, and timestamp, then sends this information to a specified email and redirects the visitor to Google.

## How to Use

1. Upload `index.php` to your web server.
2. Ensure your server is configured to send emails using the `mail` function in PHP.
3. Visit the URL where the script is hosted to see it in action.

## Configuration

You may need to adjust the `From` and `Reply-To` email addresses in the script to match your server's email configuration.
